The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there might be situations where it behaves unexpectedly or produces incorrect results if the syntax isn't meticulously followed. For example, omitting spaces around the operators or using invalid units can lead to unexpected rendering or parse errors.  Another issue arises when using `calc()` with multiple nested expressions, which can sometimes cause unexpected order of operations, and needs careful attention to parenthesis to ensure the right precedence.
